Not all community colleges look better. San Jose City College in California which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part time and returning students are included even when the time frame is extended to eight years. Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent. Most students at San Jose City College are falling short. Many community colleges have room to improve. But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates. The results produced by including all students and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a degree. And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.
