In a telephone interview Mr. Swensen noted Yale s modest holdings in domestic equity markets about 4 percent of its holdings which reduced its exposure to risk. Last year that helped he noted helping it to post a gain when many others were showing lackluster returns or a loss. But in the most recent year the allocation curtailed Yale s gains from a booming stock market. Yale continues to diversify its holdings into hedge funds where it has 25 percent of its assets and venture capital with a 17 percent stake in addition to foreign equity leveraged buyouts and real estate as well as some bonds and cash. That diversification strategy which Mr. Swensen pioneered is widely followed by larger institutions.
