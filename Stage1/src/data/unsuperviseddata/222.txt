Is there something about adjunct faculty members that makes them prone to outrageous political outbursts In August Michael Isaacson an adjunct instructor of economics at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York wrote on Twitter Some of y all might think it sucks being an anti fascist teaching at John Jay College but I think it s a privilege to teach future dead cops. Though he later said he was not wishing for his students deaths but merely predicting some would die his post was roundly condemned. He received death threats and was suspended from his job ostensibly in the interest of campus safety. There have been similar cases in recent weeks. A sociologist holding a temporary position at the University of Tampa was fired after tweeting that Hurricane Harvey was karmic payback for Republican voting Texans. Officials at California State University Fresno dismissed a history lecturer for tweeting that Trump must hang. And an adjunct instructor in gender studies who had already been fired from Rutgers lost his fall employment offer from Montclair State University after the revelation that he d tweeted about his wish to see President Trump shot. Conservative commentators have glossed these incidents as the latest evidence that college and university faculties have been taken over by left wing radicals. But the incidents might be viewed as part of a different phenomenon adjunct alienation.
