Now he said he is thrilled that the Lions are winning. I have absolutely no reservation. My feelings as an alumnus are very different from when I was a student said Stephen Holtje Columbia College class of 1983. When he was in the university s marching band he said Being a rabid sports fan was not really hip. I remember taking great delight in Columbia s perfection of the forward fumble. Today Mr. Holtje is manager of the record label ESP Disk and has a different slant. I no longer need to be hip and ironic he said. When they re losing it means nothing and I don t notice. But when they win it s like this amazing blessing out of nowhere. Mr. Holtje dismissed any notions that Columbia s current football prowess might overshadow the university s emphasis on academics. It s sufficiently obvious that we will not be Ohio State he said so we don t have to worry even if we have an undefeated season. But Mr. Passaro among others is not satisfied. For him today s Lions symbolize a cheerful rah rah Columbia that he derides as Princeton on the Hudson. To his mind the authentic Columbia is the scrappy institution of higher learning he attended in the 1970s when New York was bankrupt the Baker Field stadium was rotting and the Lions were reassuringly predictable bums. Whatever this miraculous thing is that you re telling me about I don t understand it and I don t like it Mr. Passaro said. My Columbia was a happily bohemian place and I wish it were still.
