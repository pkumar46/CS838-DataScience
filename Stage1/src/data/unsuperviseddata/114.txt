Lindsey Lemke a former Michigan State gymnast at a rally on the university&rsquo s campus in East Lansing on Jan. 26. Lemke said Dr. Nassar sexually abused her starting in junior high school and later after she enrolled at Michigan State. An investigation conducted last year by a lawyer for Michigan State cleared university officials but the details of that investigation have not been made public. A Title IX investigation in 2014 did not charge Dr. Nassar with violations but the credibility of that inquiry has recently been called into question by newly released public documents. Michigan s attorney general has said he plans a new independent investigation in the wake of reports and accusations that Michigan State officials and coaches were told of Dr. Nassar s behavior years before it became public yet did nothing to stop him from treating athletes. The former gymnastics coach Kathie Klages learned of Dr. Nassar s behavior as early as 1997 according to reports based on public documents. As late as the end of 2016 Lemke said she told Klages her coach at the time about her experience with Dr. Nassar after an article about the accusations against him appeared in The Indianapolis Star. Klages s response then Lemke recalled was to upbraid her and warn her against spreading false information.
