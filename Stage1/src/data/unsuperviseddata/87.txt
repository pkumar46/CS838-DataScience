Once they start taking college credit classes nearly three quarters of the eligible students will enroll in another CUNY initiative called Accelerated Study in Associate Programs which I ve written about in the past. The package includes financial help carefully constructed class schedules and one on one advising. Sixty four percent of ASAP students earned a degree within six years. Educators elsewhere are paying attention colleges in upstate New York Ohio and California are starting their own ASAP initiatives. And a group of New York City high school teachers are in a pilot program being trained in CUNY Start s model of teaching. It s the classic ounce of prevention approach improve teaching in high school so students won t have to take remedial math in college. CUNY Start and ASAP aren t City University s only success stories. Researchers at Stanford Berkeley and Brown universities have shown that CUNY is a more powerful engine of mobility than almost any university in the nation. Places like CUNY Stony Brook University and California State University Los Angeles are the workhorses of higher education and they re doing a fine job. I am of the bridge generation that remembers life before social media permeated everything but cannot imagine life without it now. I was a sophomore at the University of Illinois in 2004 the year TheFacebook launched and was made available to college students who went to Ivy League and Big 10 schools. I signed up for the new social network and never looked back except shadily at BlackPlanet or Myspace.
