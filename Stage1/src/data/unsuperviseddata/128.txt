But that mission has been made more difficult because many states including New York have cut spending on public higher education as tuition has increased. At CUNY which receives the bulk of its funding from New York State less money has contributed to deteriorating facilities and overcrowded classrooms most felt at its flagship campus City College in Harlem. CUNY has also been thrust into an unflattering situation under Mr. Milliken s watch on issues of governance. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are looking into several CUNY foundations for their handling of federal research money and personal expenses. Prosecutors are also investigating the former president of City College Lisa S. Coico who resigned abruptly in October 2016 after The New York Times uncovered evidence that a memo concerning her expenses had been fabricated. A permanent replacement at the college has yet to be appointed. Not long after Dr. Coico s resignation acting at the behest of William C. Thompson Jr. the chairman of CUNY s Board of Trustees and a former New York City comptroller Catherine Leahy Scott the New York State inspector general lambasted the university s financial practices as ripe for abuse in an interim report. That report prompted CUNY s board members only two of whom remain from the 17 who appointed Mr. Milliken to tighten control over its foundations. Ms. Leahy Scott s final report is still pending a spokesman for her office declined to comment. In an interview Mr. Thompson who was appointed chair of the CUNY board by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in 2016 praised Mr. Milliken s accomplishments but he added that the board should have the ability to select its leader. Do I know who the next person is said Mr. Thompson. I don t. But I know the one thing that we d be looking for is a strong leader. I think we are a great system and we re looking for somebody to take it to new heights.
